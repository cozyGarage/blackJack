Today, I revisit the project and review the code. As one of the first project I write, It has so many prolem with the code, bug and inconsistent.
The main point of refactoring the code:
 1. Use consistent naming conventions
 2. Add comments to explain the code, I add more comment to explain the code for future study.
 3. It's important to handle errors properly, especially when working with user input.
