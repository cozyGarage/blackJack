Today, I revisit the project and review the code. As one of the first project I write, It has so many prolem with the code, bug and inconsistent.
The main point of refactoring the code:
 1. Use consistent naming conventions
 2. Add comments to explain the code, I add more comment to explain the code for future study.
 3. It's important to handle errors properly, especially when working with user input.

There will be a deck of 52 cards and 2 players (computer vs player).
The goal of Black Jack is to get as close to 21 points as possible. Any player that goes past 21 loses the game.
The points of each card are as follow –
Aces can either be 1 or 11 points.
Cards from 2-10, points counted as-it-is.
The K, Q, J cards are counted as 10 points.
On the first round of the game –
The dealer and player will each be served 2 cards. The first and third cards go to the player, the second and fourth cards to the computer.
The dealer’s first card will be hidden, all other cards will face up.
The player only has to choose between 2 actions – “Hit” (get another card) and “Stand” (done, compare points with the dealer).
At stand:
Whoever goes bust loses automatically (more than 21 points).
Whoever has more points wins.
It’s a draw if both players got the same points.
The player who gets Blackjack wins.
If both players got Blackjack with 2 cards – It’s a draw.
If both players got Blackjack with 3 or more cards – It’s a draw.
